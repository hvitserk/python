# python

Hello all and welcome to my first GitHub repository! I am Hvitserk the Berserker, and I am currently learning python as my first programming language. What is contained in this project is the code from the lessons I am learning. They are 100% libre, feel free (nay, encouaged) to run, study, share / copy, and modify any of this. Also, criticisms and advice are welcomed! Thank you for visiting my repository, and happy coding!
